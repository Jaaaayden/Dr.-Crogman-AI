# Dr.-Crogman-AI
I was curious how well GPT could mimic a human's personality. It was challenging to get GPT to speak uncensored and hold a conversation with multiple people discussing separate topics, but I got it working fairly well.

# Usage
Mention the bot by @ing it to trigger responses. 

# Clone bot
Make a .env file with Discord token and OpenAI key to run the bot yourself

# Future Plans
Make the bot less vulnerable to attacks from user (ie: asking it to respond in a certain way every time)

# Credits
This project was developed using discord.py API and OpenAI API.
Special thanks to Dr. Crogman for funding the OpenAI tokens and https://pylexnodes.net/ for providing a free hosting service
